# Airline Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project specifically focused on airline reviews. The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment expressed in customer reviews of airlines and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The project is deployed using FastAPI, allowing for easy integration and usage.

## Features

- Preprocessing: The project includes preprocessing techniques like tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming/lemmatization to clean the text data from airline reviews.
- Sentiment Classification: The sentiment analysis model utilizes machine learning or deep learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of the airline reviews.
- FastAPI Deployment: The project is deployed using FastAPI, providing a robust and efficient web framework for serving the sentiment analysis model as an API.
- API Documentation: The project includes documentation for the API endpoints, allowing users to understand how to interact with the sentiment analysis service.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-sentiment-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd airline-sentiment-analysis`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your airline review data by placing it in the designated folder.
2. Run the preprocessing script: `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`
3. Train the sentiment analysis model: `main.py`
4. Start the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the sentiment analysis API by sending HTTP requests to the provided endpoints. Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on how to make requests and interpret the responses.
